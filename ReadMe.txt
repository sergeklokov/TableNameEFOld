Let's try to use really old Entity Framework 4.1 
in order to use ObjectContext and not DbContext

For this purpose, I created project targeting .Net 3.5, added Entity Framework 4.1 in it, 
and when I added Data Model, it actually offered older version or Entity Framework (3.5? ... didn't notice it)

Only then I upgraded project to .Net 4.5.2
